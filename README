An example showing how to integrate python as a command shell for verilog simulators including verilator.

See http://dungspreader.blogspot.com/ for two series of posts relating to this code.

% make -C test verilate

to run vpi put/get tests

% make -C test verilate SCRIPT=test_vpi

to run all

% make -C test regress

or if targets already built 

% test/regress

to start server (defaults to localhost:8080)

% www/report

See test/coverage.readme for information on running multiple test runs with coverage in non simulation environment.

To switch between sqlite3 and MySQL & clones remove ImportError in python/mdb/__init__.py
